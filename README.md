David's Obvious Minimal Language

I'm currently building a simple interpreter from scratch to deepen my understanding of computer science fundamentals. This project is part of my learning journey as I explore reverse engineering, binary exploitation, and low-level program behavior. It's a hands-on way for me to experiment with parsing, evaluation, and how languages work under the hood. ðŸ‘¾
